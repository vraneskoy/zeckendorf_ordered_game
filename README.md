# Ordered Zeckendorf Game â€“ Simulation Code Overview

Below is a description of the code files used for simulating and analyzing various strategies in the Ordered Zeckendorf Game.

---

### `winning_positions.cpp`
Computes all the **winning positions** for **Player 1**, given an initial value of \( N \).  
These are the positions Player 1 should aim for during their turn to guarantee a win.

---

### `random_game_length_distribution.py`
Analyzes the **distribution of game lengths** when moves are selected **uniformly at random** from all available legal moves at each step.

---

### `longest_strategy_plotting.py`
Implements the **longest-game strategy** and generates **statistics and plots** related to game length under this strategy.

---

### `longest_strategy_fitting.cpp`
Fits a **polynomial model** to the number of moves resulting from the longest-game strategy.
